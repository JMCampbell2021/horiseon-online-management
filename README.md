Info/examples needed to create a good README: 

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the [GitHub guide on mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out the [VS Code GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).
