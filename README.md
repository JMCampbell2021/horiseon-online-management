# Horiseon-online-management

For this challenge/homework assignment I defectored this existing website so that it's accessible and has an improved SEO. By doing this to the webpage it meets accessiblity standards. This gave me first hand experince on how to look at existing code and determine what codes need to be consildated and cleaned up.  

# What I changed:
I found that there were too many div elements through out the html file.  I fixed that by adding section elements where is was appropriate. 

I took the img from the hero img section of the CSS and moved it to the html file under the hero section so I can add atl with a discription. 

I added atl to all images with a discription except the image icons under the benefit section. I left those images without a discription.

In the content section I added the div id to search engine optimization so the header can link to this section.
