# Horiseon-online-management

For this challenge/homework assignment I defectored this existing website so that it's accessible and has an improved SEO. By doing this to the webpage it meets accessiblity standards. This gave me first hand experince on how to look at existing code and determine what codes need to be consildated and cleaned up.  

# What corrected 
I found that there were too many <div> elements through out the html file.  I fixed that by adding <section> elements where is was appropriate. 

I took the <img> from the hero img section of the CSS and moved it to the html file under the hero section so I can add a discription with <atl>. 

In the content section I added the <div id> for search engine optimization so the header can link to this section.
