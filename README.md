Info/examples needed to create a good README: 

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?

Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the [GitHub guide on mastering markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out the [VS Code GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

For this challenge/homework assignment I'm defector this existing website so that it's accessible and has an improved SEO. By doing this to the webpage it meets accessiblity standards. This gave me first hand experince on how to look at existing code and determine what codes need to be consildated and cleanded up.
